      (* Describes the abstracted semantics of a VCaml plugin.

         [Log] represents a request to Neovim to perform an action, and is used to record
         the [Event_tag.t] of the current context.

         [Sleep_plugin] inserts a [Clock_ns.after] for non-blocking sleep that can be used
         to delay an RPC's activity.

         [Call_neovim { name; how; specs }] represents a request or notification (given by
         [how]) to Neovim to call RPC [name], which does [specs]. Those specifications can
         be [Sleep_neovim], which puts Neovim to sleep, or [Call_plugin], which causes
         Neovim to issue a nested RPC call back to the plugin. [Sleep_neovim] has two
         varieties - blocking and non-blocking. Blocking prevents Neovim from doing
         anything else, and simulates Neovim being busy. Non-blocking invokes the `:sleep`
         command, which suspends the current job and allows others to run in the meantime.

         [Parallel plugin_specs] runs [plugin_spec]s in parallel. There isn't a natural

(* This test demonstrated a bug due to a failure to reattempt flushing before invoking a
   blocking RPC. Originally we thought that the reattempts were only needed when returning
   a response, but this test showed that that was wrong.

   The plugin sends two notifications calling Rpc_1 and Rpc_2 respectively. Rpc_1 requests
   rpc-1 from the plugin. Neovim interprets the notification calling Rpc_2 as nested, and
   spends a millisecond being busy. Meanwhile, the plugin receives the request for rpc-1
   and sends a dummy request to flush Neovim's event loop. Then Neovim moves on to the
   next item in Rpc_2, which is to request rpc-2 from the plugin. The plugin receives the
   request for rpc-2 and interprets it as a nested call. It sends a dummy for rpc-2.
   Neovim receives the dummy for rpc-1 and then rpc-2 and responds to both. The plugin
   receives both dummy responses, and since rpc-2 has permission to run, it runs (doing
   nothing) and returns. The plugin flushes to see if it's safe to return the response; it
   is, and the plugin returns the response. The plugin then returns permission to run to
   rpc-1, which sends a [Log] request. Meanwhile, when Neovim received the response to
   rpc-2, it moved on to requesting rpc-3. The plugin receives the request for rpc-3,
   takes permission to run from rpc-1, and runs the [Log] for rpc-3. When rpc-3 is done,
   permission is returned again to rpc-1. Thus rpc-1 is interleaved by rpc-3.

   The purpose of keeping Neovim busy is that if Neovim immediately called rpc-2 after
   calling rpc-1, the plugin may seize permission to run from rpc-1 before sending the
   dummy for it, thereby postponing the dummy until after returning from rpc-2 and
   avoiding the problem. *)

(* Demonstrate a bug that can arise due to Neovim's [sleep] defeating VCaml's flushing.
   The plugin requests Rpc_1, leading Neovim to request rpc-1 and await a response. rpc-1
   sends a notification invoking Rpc_2, which sleeps. Because it was a notification, rpc-1
   does not await a response, so it's ready to return. The plugin flushes Neovim's event
   loop with a dummy request, and that request returns successfully because sleep removed
   Rpc_2 from the loop. Then Rpc_2 wakes from sleep and rpcrequests rpc-2. Neovim returns
   the result to rpc-1, which is an out-of-order response, so Neovim closes the

  (* This low-level hook in the VCaml client is needed to demonstrate this scenario
     because the timing needs to be coordinated delicately. The specific sequence of
     events that needs to happen is:

     1. The dummy request sent to determine whether it's safe to return rpc-1 returns
     without any RPCs being invoked in the interim, indicating that it's safe.
     2. Neovim wakes and requests rpc-2.
     3. The plugin sends the response to rpc-1.

     If Rpc_2 sleeps for too long before sending rpc-2, Neovim may successfully process
     the response to rpc-1. If Rpc_2 sleeps for too little time before sending rpc-2,
     rpc-2 will be invoked before the dummy returns, and the plugin will determine that it
     is unsafe to respond to rpc-1. So, we need to inject a period of time between the
     dummy returning indicating it's safe to respond and actually sending the response
     during which sending the response becomes unsafe. *)

(* Demonstrate a bug that can arise due to Neovim's [sleep] defeating VCaml's flushing.
   The plugin requests Rpc_1, then Rpc_2. Neovim receives Rpc_1, which tells it to
   rpcrequest rpc-1 from the plugin. Then it receives Rpc_2, which it interprets as a
   nested request. Rpc_2 puts itself to sleep, which allows Neovim to continue processing
   received messages. When the plugin receives rpc-1, it flushes Neovim's event loop with
   a dummy request, and that request returns successfully because sleep removed Rpc_2 from
   the loop. Then rpc-1 begins, and while it's running, Rpc_2 wakes from sleep and
   rpcrequests rpc-2, interleaving rpc-1. *)
